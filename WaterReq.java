/**
    Finally, after purchasing a water cooler during the April long challenge, Chef noticed that his water cooler requires 2 liters of water to cool for one hour.

    How much water (in liters) would be required by the cooler to cool for N hours?

    Input Format:
    The first line of input will contain an integer T â€” the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N, as described in the problem statement.

    Output Format:
    For each test case, output the number of liters of water required by the water cooler to cool for N hours.

    Constraints:
    1 <= T <= 1000
    1 <= N <= 1000

    Sample Input 1:
    2
    1
    2

    Sample Output 2:
    2
    4
